<title>iOS Dualboot - Jailbreak</title>

</head>

<body>

<div class="main">
<h1>Jailbreak</h1>
I've never liked jailbreak. The only purpose to install it for me is ability to dualboot back to iOS 6<br><br>
You may have different opinion, so I give few recommendations:
<ul>
<li>Remove code signing related boot-args. I'm not sure about <b>p0sixspwn</b> or <b>evasi0n</b>, but <b>Pangu 7.1.x</b> untether failed when I tried to boot with these boot arguments</li><br>
<li>Downgrade iTunes. <b>MobileDevice</b> framework, which is used by jailbreak utilities, updates together with iTunes. That means, older jailbreaks won't work with modern iTunes versions</li><br>
<li>Jailbreak process usually implies few reboots while it. Disconnect your device shortly after it starts to reboot and connect back only when second OS is about to show SpringBoard</li>
</ul>
